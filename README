friendly_brief parses brief titles from a CSV file and emits a new CSV file
with some inferences about the brief. A brief title might look like this.

    1.    Amicus Brief, BRIEF OF L. S. LEE, INC. AMICUS CURIAE ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, December 6, 2000, 2000 U.S. S. Ct. Briefs LEXIS 836 

For such a title, friendly_brief tries to guess the

* Brief number
* Amici curiae
* Position of the amici

How to use
--------------
Install it from pip. ::

    pip3 install friendly_brief

And run it on a CSV file. The file must contain a column with all of the
brief titles that you care about, and the titles must be in a column called
"brief". The CSV file can have anything else you want in it too. ::

    friendly-brief briefs.csv

It can also receive a CSV file over stdin.

    cat briefs.csv | friendly-brief

The resulting CSV file is written to stdout.

How it works
---------------
Let's discuss how each of the inferences is made.
