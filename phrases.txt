Hi Tom,

I'm sending you 3 documents: a spreadsheet and a word document with the
information I need to scrap for 45 cases, as well as a spreadsheet with
what the final product would look like.  This last spreadsheet includes
only two cases with some of their respective briefs in it.

The phrases that identify the parties and posture, as well as the coding
that I'm using is the following:

Amici are separated by commas (,) and conjuctions (and), but some of them
include commas and/or periods (,.) within their name (e.g., Inc., ).

Document: Brief, amicus brief, amici brief, or motion for leave to file and
brief:
Prepositions indicating Author: of, by, for

Preposition indicating posture: on behalf of, in support of, for

Posture and coding:

Petitioner/s = Appellant/s = Reversal è 1

Respondent/s = Appellee/s = Affirmance è 2

Neither party è 0

Plaintiff/s è3

Defendant/s è 4

Two other colums are being coded as follows, but if this information is too
much to code for, you can leave that out.

Coding for amicus brief: 1 for single person, 2 for more than one person, 3
for single collective entity (government, business, organization, Indian
tribe, etc.), 4 for more than one collective entity.


Coding for Type of amici: individual person (1), organizations (2),
government entity (3 for agency, department, state, tribe, Indian nation,
the U.S., a foreign government, etc.), state legislators (4), federal
legislators (5), judges (6), bar associations, legal foundation, or law
firms (7), law schools, law professors or law school clinics (8), other
schools (9), other professional associations or organizations (10), union
or workers center (11), business/industrial/commercial entity (12), and
organizations expressly or impliedly identified as alliance/coalition (13).

Let me know what you think.
Best,
Cesar
